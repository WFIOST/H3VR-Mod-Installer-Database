These bosses are very difficult, but will always drop some kind of item.\n\n(The current version of PMC Pete is lower than the version listed on mod installer, this is a technical necessity due to the way mod installer works, don't worry, everything is probably fine.)",

When you buy a gun from the supply room, it will come kitted out exactly like it was in the movie when John used it.\nAdditionally, custom sosigs have been created to mirror the kinds of enemies that John faces in the three movies. Early sosigs, for example, will be unarmored and have pistols only. But beware the final holds when the High Table enforcers kick in the door.",
