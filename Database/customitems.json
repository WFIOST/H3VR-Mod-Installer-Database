This meaty pack expands on Kamikaze Fox's ModulAR platform with countless additional items; Receivers, Handguards, Stocks, Pistolgrips, this has it all. Please install Kamikaze's ModulAR for the base content like barrels.\nReceivers and Pistolgrips can be found under Pistol - Lever Action Handgun\nHandguards and grips are found under Attachments - Foregrips\nStocks are found under Attachments - Stocks\nTo install: follow all requirements for LSIIC and Sideloader, then drag the zip into your virtualobjects folder. If you don't have one, create one.\nHandy tips: Pistol grips are best detached by grabbing slightly in front of the bottom of the grip when attached.\nHandguards are best attached after barrels, and are easiest to attach in a quickbelt slot like your shoulder.",

This will be the smoothest process. Place them more or less where you think they should go, and they should snap into place.\nSome minor issues: Due to how attachments work in H3, Fores and Barrels technically attach to the lower receiver, not the upper. Other minor issues: Visual stuff that works on vanilla AR's like dustcover interaction and charging handle latch rotation does not work for now.",

Comes with a 20 round magazine. The only thing holding it back is the lack of AP ammo in 9x18 in game. \nDue to code limitations on the game's handgun script, I am unable to get the proper three position selector/decocker and SA/DA operation (somehow broken on full auto pistols)- therefore, the weapon only has semi and full selector positions and is single action. Doesn't change much gameplay wise, just an inaccuracy. ",

The newer one offers easy viewing through its glass panels, while the old one allows use of iron sights with its center cutout. They are attachable to any picatinny rail, and can be found at the end of the list under Attachments > Decorative\nThese will block most gunfire from the front- some shots may slip around, especially with the old style shield, but overall you'll be protected from the enemy, especially at range. Some sosig guns, mainly the snipers, will penetrate, so watch out! \nNOTICE: Will lag quite badly with more than one shield attached when in Direct simulation mode! Switch to floating mode in the options panel under Simulation/Game options to remedy- my testing on my pretty weak PC let me get to at least 8 shields without much lag when moving. Make sure to reload the scene to finish changing this setting!\nKnown issues:\nThe modern shield freaks out and flies off a bit when spawning- this is just due to its positioning when it spawns in and I'm not sure how to change that!

			"Version": "1.0.0",
			"Description": "Adds a functioning flash shield to the game. The shield is powered by 23mm 'Batteries'; spawn one from the ammo spawner, open the 'battery compartment' with a side press on the touchpad, insert the 'battery', and close it with another touchpad press. Activate the flash with the trigger when necessary, and then you can open the 'battery compartment' up again and tilt the shield to discard the empty 'battery'. Note that opening the 'battery compartment' primes the flash system, indicated by the status light turning green: if you hit the trigger while it's open on accident, you can just open and close it again to re-arm it.\nIn terms of protection, the center of the shield is strongest and nearly impenetrable. Rifle rounds and more powerful can penetrate the glass if they come in at a solid angle, so mind how you fight!\nAlso features some fancy parallax-enabled custom bullet impact decals and sounds, because getting shot at is scary and inconvenient.\n\nCredits\n\nAll assets from Modern Warfare '19\n\nTo do:\n\n* Andrew_FTW has offered to create an ammo box for the 'batteries' to spawn alongside the shields to eliminate the need for the ammo spawner, which would be super convenient; I intend to implement that as soon as he's got it ready\n\nWhat the hell is a 23mm battery?\n\nOkay, nerd, I'll break kayfabe for you. The shield achieves its flash effect using the KS-23's flashbang shells, which are the ammo you need to spawn and load into it. For convenience's sake, I recommend vaulting a shield with a shell loaded so you don't need to get the ammo spawner out every time you use it.\nIf you're technically curious: Because H3's zvezda shells fire a magical flashbang grenade instead of being a flashbang shell, the 'muzzle' of the shield is pointed inwards towards itself to get it to detonate immediately. This also means you can't load and use any projectiles to create a funny lethal shield.",
